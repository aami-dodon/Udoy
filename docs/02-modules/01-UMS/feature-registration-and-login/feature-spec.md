# Feature: UMS - Secure registration and login with age-appropriate flows

## Description
Secure registration and login with age-appropriate flows that cover all UMS roles (Students, Creators, Validators, Coaches/Guardians, Sponsors, Platform Admins).

## Scope
- Core flow per module overview
- Role-appropriate access and validation
- Offline/low-bandwidth considerations where applicable
- Localization where applicable
- Differentiated onboarding inputs per role (e.g., content portfolio for Creators, organization linkage for Sponsors, elevated verification for Admins)
- Guardian-assisted flows for minor Students and delegated coach access

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implements described behavior end-to-end
- Validations, error states, and edge cases defined
- Access control and audit/logging where applicable
- Metrics/observability hooks added (if applicable)

## Role-specific Registration and Login Expectations
- **Students**: Self-service signup with age gate; minors require guardian approval before activation. Login supports guardian-assisted recovery.
- **Creators**: Invitation or application-based signup capturing subject expertise; requires validation approval before publishing rights are granted.
- **Validators**: Invited by Admins with multi-factor verification; login enforces stricter session policies due to elevated permissions.
- **Coaches**: Linked to one or more Students; onboarding collects relationship verification and consent artifacts.
- **Sponsors**: Organization-backed accounts with required billing or memorandum of understanding (MoU) information; login enables cohort analytics.
- **Platform Admins**: Provisioned centrally with hardware-token-backed MFA and strict IP/risk checks.
